## Introduction

LabFollow is a mobile app designed to emphasise the communication between doctors and their patients via studies. Studies are personalised sets of questions created by a doctor for a patient, who then answers them and send them back to their doctor.

The goal is to create a new way of dialogue between a doctor and its patient: one which would be not be time-consuming and which would be easy to understand and use.

It would also facilitate the gathering of data (while respecting the patientsâ€™ privacy) to help doctors know what they should be improving in their own work.

- node & npm
